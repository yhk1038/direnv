## üìã Task Overview

### Goal
Remove the dangerous `eval` of remote content in install.sh and uninstall.sh, replacing it with safe local file loading.

### Background
**Current security vulnerability**:
```sh
# install.sh:23-28 and uninstall.sh:22-28
LANG_CONTENT=$(curl -fsSL "$LANG_URL")
eval "$LANG_CONTENT"
```

**Risks**:
1. **Remote Code Execution**: If GitHub is compromised or DNS hijacked, arbitrary code can be executed
2. **No Integrity Verification**: No checksums or signatures
3. **Network Dependency**: Installation fails if GitHub is unreachable
4. **Trust Model Issue**: Users must trust the network path completely

### Scope
**Included**:
- [x] Include language files (en.lang, ko.lang) in release tar.gz
- [ ] Modify install.sh to load from local extracted files
- [ ] Modify uninstall.sh to load from local extracted files
- [ ] Write tests to verify secure loading
- [ ] Fallback mechanism if language file missing
- [ ] Update release process to include lang files

**Excluded**:
- Removing eval from other scripts (none exist)
- Adding new languages (ja.lang can be added later)

## üí° Design and Approach

### Initial Ideas

**Chosen approach: Include lang files in tar.gz**
1. Modify pack.sh to include src/lang/ in the archive
2. Install.sh extracts tar.gz ‚Üí lang files are already there
3. Source lang files directly from local filesystem
4. No remote download needed

### Technical Approach

**Before** (insecure):
```sh
# Download and eval remote content
LANG_CONTENT=$(curl -fsSL "$LANG_URL")
eval "$LANG_CONTENT"
```

**After** (secure):
```sh
# Load from extracted local files
LANG_FILE="$INSTALL_DIR/src/lang/${LANG_CODE}.lang"
if [ -f "$LANG_FILE" ]; then
  . "$LANG_FILE"
else
  # Fallback to English
  . "$INSTALL_DIR/src/lang/en.lang"
fi
```

### TDD Approach

**Test 1: Verify lang files included in tar.gz**
```sh
test_lang_files_in_tarball() {
  tar -tzf direnv-*.tar.gz | grep -q "src/lang/en.lang"
  tar -tzf direnv-*.tar.gz | grep -q "src/lang/ko.lang"
}
```

**Test 2: Install without network (lang files available)**
```sh
test_install_without_network() {
  # Disconnect network simulation
  # Run install.sh
  # Verify lang variables loaded
}
```

**Test 3: No eval in install scripts**
```sh
test_no_eval_in_install() {
  ! grep "eval.*LANG_CONTENT" install.sh
}
```

### Related Files
- `install.sh` - Remove eval, load from local
- `uninstall.sh` - Remove eval, load from local
- `pack.sh` - Include lang files in tar.gz
- `release.sh` - Verify pack.sh includes lang files
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Update if needed

### Expected Issues

**Issue 1: Chicken-and-egg problem in install.sh**
- Problem: Lang files are inside tar.gz, but we need messages before extraction
- Solution: Use hardcoded minimal messages before extraction, load lang after extraction

**Issue 2: uninstall.sh runs from ~/.direnv**
- Problem: Lang files already available at ~/.direnv/src/lang/
- Solution: Load from installed location, with fallback

## üìù Progress Log

### 2025-10-23 - Task Started
- Created task document following workflow
- Analyzed security vulnerability in install.sh:23-28 and uninstall.sh:22-28
- Decided on approach: include lang files in tar.gz
- TDD approach: write tests first, then implement

**Next steps**:
1. Write failing tests for secure installation
2. Modify pack.sh to include lang files
3. Modify install.sh to load from local
4. Modify uninstall.sh to load from local
5. Verify all tests pass

## üîß Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Include lang files in tar.gz vs hardcoding
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Problem**: How to eliminate eval without losing i18n support
- **Options**:
  1. Include lang files in tar.gz (chosen)
  2. Hardcode all messages in install.sh
  3. Keep eval but add checksum verification
- **Decision**: Option 1 - Include in tar.gz
- **Reason**:
  - Most secure (no remote code execution)
  - Maintains clean i18n structure
  - No network dependency
  - Minimal complexity increase
  - Tar.gz size increase negligible (~2KB)

### Decision 2: Timing of lang file loading
- **Date**: 2025-10-23
- **Problem**: install.sh needs messages before tar.gz extraction
- **Options**:
  1. Hardcode minimal messages, load full lang after extraction
  2. Extract lang files first, then full extraction
  3. Inline all messages before extraction
- **Decision**: Option 1
- **Reason**:
  - Simple and clear
  - Only critical early messages hardcoded
  - Full i18n after extraction
  - No double extraction needed

## üìå Notes

**Critical security improvement**:
- This change eliminates a **HIGH severity** security vulnerability
- Users will no longer execute arbitrary remote code during installation
- Network failures won't block installation
- More resilient and secure by design

**Testing philosophy**:
- TDD approach: write tests first
- Tests should fail initially
- Implementation makes tests pass
- Refactor with confidence
