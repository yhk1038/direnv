## 📋 Task Overview

### Goal
Create comprehensive troubleshooting documentation to help users diagnose and resolve common direnv issues quickly and independently.

### Background
Users encounter various issues when using direnv:
- Installation problems
- Permission errors
- Shell integration issues
- .envrc not loading
- Environment variable conflicts
- Performance issues

A well-structured troubleshooting guide reduces support burden and improves user experience.

### Scope
**Included**:
- [ ] Common issues and solutions
- [ ] Diagnostic commands and techniques
- [ ] Step-by-step troubleshooting workflows
- [ ] FAQ section
- [ ] Known limitations and workarounds
- [ ] How to report bugs effectively

**Excluded**:
- Detailed API documentation (belongs in other docs)
- Advanced configuration examples (covered in task-02)
- Contribution guidelines (covered in backlog)

## 💡 Design and Approach

### Initial Ideas
Structure:
1. Quick diagnostic checklist
2. Common issues by category
3. Detailed troubleshooting workflows
4. FAQ
5. When/how to report bugs

Each issue should include:
- Symptoms
- Common causes
- Diagnostic steps
- Solutions
- Prevention tips

### Technical Approach
- Create `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` in repository root or `docs/`
- Use clear categories and table of contents
- Include command examples users can copy-paste
- Link from main README
- Keep updated as new issues are discovered

### Related Files
- `README.md` - Link to troubleshooting guide
- `docs/` directory (if exists)

### Expected Issues
- Keeping guide up-to-date as code evolves
- Balancing comprehensiveness with readability
- Platform-specific troubleshooting (macOS vs Linux)
